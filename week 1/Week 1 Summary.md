# Week 1: Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

## Overview
This week focused on preparing raw learner engagement data for analysis by cleaning inconsistencies, handling missing values, removing duplicates, and creating derived features for deeper insights.

## Key Tasks
- Standardized column names and categorical values
- Parsed date fields into datetime objects
- Handled missing values in critical columns
- Removed duplicate rows
- Created new features:
  - Age
  - Engagement Duration
  - Opportunity Duration
  - Dropout flag
  - Engagement Score
  - Days Since Last Engagement

## Challenges
- Some date fields had inconsistent formats
- Missing values in "Institution Name" and opportunity dates required careful handling

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (initial inspection)
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)

## Outcomes
Clean dataset ready for exploratory data analysis and modeling
